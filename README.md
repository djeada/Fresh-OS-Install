# Fresh OS Installation Guide

Congratulations on installing your new operating system! Follow this comprehensive guide to seamlessly restore all your necessary files, configurations, and applications without unnecessary bloat. This guide is tailored for Linux Mint but can be adapted to other lightweight distributions as needed.

## Restore Files from USB

I. **Connect USB Drive:**  

Make sure your USB drive is properly formatted and contains all your backup files. Insert the USB drive into an available USB port on your computer and wait for the system to recognize and mount the USB drive automatically.

II. **Identify Mount Point:**  

Open the file manager to locate the USB drive, typically found under `/media/your_username/USB_NAME` or `/mnt/usb`. Alternatively, use the terminal command `lsblk` to list all block devices and identify the mount point of your USB drive.

III. **Copy Necessary Folders:**  

Copy your necessary folders from the USB drive to your home directory using the following commands:

```bash
cp -r /media/usb/Downloads ~/Downloads
cp -r /media/usb/Desktop ~/Desktop
cp -r /media/usb/Documents ~/Documents
cp -r /media/usb/Pictures ~/Pictures
cp -r /media/usb/Music ~/Music
cp -r /media/usb/Videos ~/Videos
```

Replace `/media/usb/` with the actual mount point of your USB drive.

IV. **Restore Hidden Configuration Files:**  
Hidden files, which start with a dot, contain important configurations. Use the command `cp -r /media/usb/.* ~/` to copy all hidden files from the USB to your home directory. Be cautious as this may overwrite existing configuration files. Make sure you have backups if necessary.

V. **Set Correct Permissions:**  

After copying, make sure that all files have the correct permissions by running:

```bash
chmod -R u+rwX,go-rwX ~/ 
```

This command grants read, write, and execute permissions to the user and removes read and write permissions for group and others.

VI. **Verify File Integrity:**  

Check that all files have been copied successfully by listing the contents of each directory:

```bash
ls ~/Downloads
ls ~/Desktop
ls ~/Documents
```

Compare the contents with your USB drive to make sure completeness.

VII. **Update File References:**  

Some applications may have absolute paths pointing to the old system. Update these references as needed to match your new system's directory structure.

VIII. **Safely Eject USB Drive:**  

Once all files are copied and verified, safely eject the USB drive to prevent data corruption. Use the eject option in the file manager or execute the terminal command `sudo umount /media/usb`. Wait for confirmation that the drive has been unmounted before physically removing it.

## Restore System Configurations

I. **Restore Network Settings:**  

Copy your network configuration files to restore Wi-Fi and Ethernet settings using the following commands:

```bash
cp /media/usb/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf /etc/NetworkManager/
cp -r /media/usb/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/ /etc/NetworkManager/
```

Restart the Network Manager service with `sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager`.

II. **Restore User Preferences:**  

Transfer user-specific settings such as themes, keyboard shortcuts, and display preferences by executing:

```bash
cp -r /media/usb/.config ~/.config
cp -r /media/usb/.local ~/.local
```

Make sure that the ownership of the copied files matches your current user by running:

```bash
chown -R $(whoami)$(whoami) ~/.config ~/.local
```

III. **Restore Shell Configurations:**  

Copy shell configuration files to retain aliases and environment variables:

```bash
cp /media/usb/.bashrc ~/
